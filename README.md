## 1. Install v8 (5 mins)

**v8** is Google's Javascript engine (used in Chrome). Install it using `brew` so we can run JS programs from the command line:

```bash
brew install v8
```

Test everything's working by running the `v8` command in your shell - you should see something like:

```bash
> V8 version 3.15.11 [sample shell]
```

## 2. Read through Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock code (20 mins)

Go through the code in the `ruby/` directory - it's a very simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Read through the code & specs, and be ready to talk about:

- Is there anything going on that I don't understand?
- Is there anything wrong with the code? (<strong>Spoiler</strong>: there is!) What could be done better?
